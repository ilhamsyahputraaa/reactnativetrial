Meanwhile, Daisuke Sorai had just reached his long-sought goal of becoming an aerobatics pilot only to injure his leg, crushing his chances at ever becoming a member of the elite Blue Impulse flying team. He gets assigned to the force's public relations desk and subsequently finds himself attached to Rika in the role of attendant. Sorai and Rika differ on just about everything; their views, their mindset. But they share one thing: their childhood dreams have been shattered and they've hit a wall in life. From there, a mutual understanding begins to germinate, drawing them toward each other and toward the discovery of a new dream.",

The branch is run by the show’s protagonist, Avi Meshulam, a 40-year-old loser, who’s overweight and has severe self-image issues that turn him into a liar, a suck-up, and a generally unbearable human being. He’s absolutely sure that he’s a wonderful standup comedian, who wound up in this boring, humiliating job purely by chance. Management is constantly trying to fire him, his employees despise him, yet he is ever the optimist, and he talks in catch phrases lifted from the most banal management books. He is surrounded by the range of characters that make up the impossible mosaic of Israeli society. Romance flourishes, schemes are hatched, lamination machines are sold on sale– and everybody tries to make it through yet another day with their unbearable boss.",

        "Rika Inaba is a beautiful and strong-headed director at the Teito Television Broadcasting Company. Ever since she was young, she had dreamed of becoming the best news reporter in the business, but on into her fifth year with the TV station, she finds to her dismay she's been transferred to a lighter fare, information program where she is assigned to report on the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. Meanwhile, Daisuke Sorai had just reached his long-sought goal of becoming an aerobatics pilot only to injure his leg, crushing his chances at ever becoming a member of the elite Blue Impulse flying team. He gets assigned to the force's public relations desk and subsequently finds himself attached to Rika in the role of attendant. Sorai and Rika differ on just about everything; their views, their mindset. But they share one thing: their childhood dreams have been shattered and they've hit a wall in life. From there, a mutual understanding begins to germinate, drawing them toward each other and toward the discovery of a new dream.",

        "“The Office” is a mocumentary series based on the British show of the same name. Somewhere within the industrial area of Yahud is a grey, drab office, the failing branch of an office supply company heroically named “Paper-Office”. The branch is run by the show’s protagonist, Avi Meshulam, a 40-year-old loser, who’s overweight and has severe self-image issues that turn him into a liar, a suck-up, and a generally unbearable human being. He’s absolutely sure that he’s a wonderful standup comedian, who wound up in this boring, humiliating job purely by chance. Management is constantly trying to fire him, his employees despise him, yet he is ever the optimist, and he talks in catch phrases lifted from the most banal management books. He is surrounded by the range of characters that make up the impossible mosaic of Israeli society. Romance flourishes, schemes are hatched, lamination machines are sold on sale– and everybody tries to make it through yet another day with their unbearable boss.",
